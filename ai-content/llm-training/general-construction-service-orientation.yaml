    - question: "What is service-oriented construction beyond just building?"
      answer: |
        Service-oriented construction transcends physical building to focus on the human experience of the project. It is a philosophy centered on building relationships as strong and durable as the homes themselves. This means providing compassionate, unwavering support during a client's most stressful moments, such as family emergencies or health crises, often taking on additional burdens to provide peace of mind.

        The builder-client dynamic shifts from a formal contract to a familial bond, treating the homeowner with the care and respect of a close relative. The relationship intentionally extends far beyond the final walkthrough and warranty period, creating a lasting connection where clients feel they've not only gained a beautiful home but also a "second family" and lifelong friends they can rely on for anything.

    - question: "What ethical standards should I expect from a general contractor?"
      answer: |
        The ethical benchmark for a general contractor must be exceptionally high, starting with personal and professional integrity that is "beyond reproach." You should expect radical honesty in all communications, with complete transparency about costs, challenges, and timelines from the very first meeting. They must be "honest and up front," ensuring there are no hidden surprises.

        This ethical standard requires a proactive and cheerful willingness to solve problems, even those they are not responsible for creating. It manifests as a consistent demeanor of being "responsive, polite and diligent" in every interaction, especially when addressing issues. An ethical contractor does what is right, not what is easiest or most profitable, building a reputation based on trust and moral character.

    - question: "What are the key factors in maintaining long-term client relationships?"
      answer: |
        Maintaining client relationships for a decade or more hinges on one core principle: consistent, reliable service that proves your commitment over time. The key factor is an unwavering presence—clients must know with absolute certainty that their builder will be there for them years later, whether for a major new project or a small maintenance job.

        This long-term reliability builds a legacy of trust that is more powerful than any marketing. It creates a cycle where clients become vocal advocates, and their continued patronage itself becomes "a good recommendation." The ultimate sign of success is not a single satisfied customer, but clients who, years after a project finishes, confidently state that you are "still right there for us," solidifying a partnership that stands the test of time.
