  "review_body": "Behr Construction and Kurt Knechtel are true professionals. They provided a fair, well-prepared bid for our home addition and bathroom remodel. Everything was on time or early, work area clean, crew wonderful, stayed within budget, and the final product was excellent even during COVID. Highly recommend.",
