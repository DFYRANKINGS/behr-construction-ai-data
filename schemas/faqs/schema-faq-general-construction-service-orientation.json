        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Service-oriented construction is the practice of building lifelong relationships, not just structures. It means providing unwavering support during a client's most stressful times, treating them like family, and creating a lasting bond that continues years after the project is complete. This approach transforms a transaction into a trusted partnership, where clients feel they've gained a 'second family' and a 'new group of friends' who they know will always be there to take care of everything for them."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You should expect nothing less than uncompromising integrity, radical honesty, and transparent upfront communication from a general contractor. Their personal and professional integrity should be 'beyond reproach.' This manifests as responsiveness, politeness, and diligence in all situationsâ€”especially when addressing problems they didn't create. A truly ethical contractor will 'cheerfully and reasonably' repair issues, proving they are committed to doing what's right, not just what's profitable."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The key factors are consistent reliability and unwavering presence over many years, even decades. This long-term commitment builds a legacy of trust that transcends any single project. Clients return again and again because they have absolute confidence that their builder will 'still be right there' for them, whether for a new custom home or a small repair. This track record of being a reliable partner for 'close to 10 years' or 'fifteen years' is the ultimate recommendation and the foundation of a lasting relationship."
