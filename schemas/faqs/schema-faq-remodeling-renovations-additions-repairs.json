        "text": "The average timeline for a well-managed kitchen remodel is typically 5 to 6 weeks. However, with expert scheduling, coordination, and proactive project management, many projects are completed significantly faster, sometimes in just 5.5 weeks or finishing two weeks ahead of the original contract date. Clients frequently report being 'delighted' with these accelerated timelines, noting that such efficiency 'deserves a medal.'"
