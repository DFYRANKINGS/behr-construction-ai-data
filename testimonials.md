# Client Testimonials

## Deb Schofield
> "Building a house with Behr Construction was a wonderful experience, not only did I get a beautifully built home, but I also feel like I’ve got a second family."

## Anne Buettner
> "When our prior contractor would not return calls after completing a project, we called Behr Construction. Behr cheerfully and reasonably repaired windows that leaked, tile grout that needed to be filled, and a bathroom faucet that sprayed water from an improper seal. I cannot say enough great things about your group. They were responsive, polite and diligent. While there to fix the problems, Behr performed a number of other projects for us including building a walk-in closet, laying tumbled marble in a bathroom, and installing a gas line to the fireplace. They are the handyman I didn’t marry and a great community asset!
>
> Thank you, Behr Construction!"

## Dana & Myrna McCune
> "Myrna and I had the pleasure of working with Chris Behr and Behr Construction on several occasions over the last 15 years. It is therefore with considerable experience, the greatest of confidence, and the highest of praise that I commend Chris Behr and Behr Construction.
>
> As a person, Chris Behr’s integrity is beyond reproach. He was raised in La Canada and still maintains a residence in this area, making him a very accessible figure in this community. He gives generously to numerous community causes and organizations.
>
> As a contractor, he runs a company that both demands and delivers perfection. His employees and independent contractors are, without exception, courteous, timely, and well qualified.
>
> I do not take referrals lightly and give them quite sparingly. However, it is with absolutely no reservation that I strongly recommend Chris Behr and Behr Construction Company for virtually any construction project. His innovative ideas (typically impressing architects, designers, and decorators), high quality of workmanship, accessibility, and sense of responsibility set him apart from his counterparts in this field."

>

## Joyce Thompsen & John Wright
> "The purpose of this letter is to express our sincere gratitude and great satisfaction with the workmanship, timely completion, and indefatigable, thorough project management conducted by Kurt Knechtel and all members of his various crews and suppliers.
>
> We were delighted to take possession of a sparkling new kitchen in just 5.5 weeks, much less than anticipated. Furthermore, we continue to receive many compliments about the design and craftsmanship.
> Another dimension is worthy of mentioning. We found that all crew personnel arrived on schedule, then fastidiously attended to details, safety, and tidiness in their workspace. We were also quite appreciative of the respectfulness and ease with which they engaged with us and responded to any questions.
>
> We especially want to give high praise to Kurt for his careful attention to every perspective of the project and ensuring that we would be entirely satisfied at every stage.
>
> If your firm requires a reference, we would be happy to comply as we are able. All we ask is for advance notice by email and allowance for our occasional travel schedule."

## Mr. & Mrs. Morris
> "Thanks for jobs well done! Your personal commitment to maintaining the quality of your men’s work, and your patience in explaining work in progress and the time frame necessary made a long, arduous project manageable without a complete reorganization of our lives! Myron and I will tell others of our satisfaction with the quality of your work."

## Freida Maloney
> "Just a note to let you know how very pleased we are with your company’s well organized work and the nice finished result.
>
> Thank you very much!"

## Joyce Davison
> "When I remodeled my home, I called Chris Behr because of his excellent reputation. He and I worked very well together on plans for this project on a house built in 1929. He has so many wonderful ideas that work and make my home very comfortable. He and his employees and sub-contractors are all very professional, know their jobs and are the best I could have asked to work with. I am very satisfied and happy with the results. I have recommended Behr Construction firm to all my friends and will continue to do so."

## Venetta & Peter Tassopulos
> "Behr Construction Company deserves our highest recommendation. We are able to enjoy our wonderful new kitchen and skillfully laid driveway because of the attentive workers and because of the ever attentive supervisor John Mills who, when found necessary, was willing to make necessary adjustments. Workers and supervisor gave high priority to our concerns which ensured a high level of satisfaction."

## Betsy & Jeff Hall
> "Thank you for doing a superior remodel! The bathroom is beautiful and functional. Please thank all the fine craftsmen who did such wonderful work and were so considerate while in our house.
> Thanks again-we love our new bath."

## Jeffrey Spencer
> "My wife and I gave a lot of thought last night to what you talked about and we have decided that this will be our new home. I wanted to let you know that your recommendation, along with those of others in the community, had a big part in our final decision and I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to talk to me. We will always feel that you played an important part in our decision to settle in this wonderful friendly town. Thank you again for your input.
>
> P.S. We look forward to joining the community and providing quality work. It was interesting that I would recognize the photos of one of your reconstructions in my mom’s neighborhood when I stopped by the other day. Your comments were most helpful. Will be there soon! Best of luck with your new projects."

## Cary and Tamara Fine
> "Working with your construction company has been a wonderful experience for my wife and me.
>
> First of all, our clear communication together, listening to your suggestions, helping us in making difficult decisions by giving us the pros and cons of doing one thing or another, being there to always make sure that everything was moving along correctly, gave us the confidence that you were the “best of the best.”
>
> Your meeting with the workers and meeting with us on a continual basis, keeping us totally informed on the work done and the next construction activity made us feel reassured every step of the way because of your expertise in remodeling a home and your great communication skills.
>
> We really worked together and it was not a simple project. We were remodeling our home and building a new room, enlarging rooms, knocking out walls, widening small archways, putting in a new kitchen floor tiles and counter tops, building a new bathroom putting in LED lights instead of our older model lights, updating our electricity, adding air conditioning… I could go on and on, but my Thank You is clear. You are a wonderful and knowledgeable group of people to work with.
>
> Your work ethic and communication skills put you over the top. Even though the remodel and new construction was completed in 2013, we have continued to rely on your wonderful company by hiring your company for smaller projects. You are still right there for us. You always remember your clients as we remember you and your great work.
>
> Whenever the opportunity arises, I always enthusiastically recommend Behr Construction to our friends and colleagues."

## Glenn Cunningham
> "The Behr Construction Company has recently completed its second remodeling/restoration task in the past two years for me.
>
> The first job was the total remodel of my 1960’s vintage ranch style home. Working to my designs, the building was stripped to the open studs, interior walls removed and relocated, all the windows and doors were replaced, the electrical wiring was completely replaced, lots of concrete work was accomplished and the roof replaced. I was very pleased with all of the work, with the quality and craftsmanship of Behr’s in-house personnel and their subs. The job was well managed and completed on schedule at the agreed to cost. The finished work was so good that the house was chosen to be featured in the ASID Pasadena Chapter 2014 Kitchen and Home Tour.
>
> Based upon their excellent performance on the house remodel, I engaged Behr for the restoration of my beach condo following significant water damage. The drywall and electrical systems were replaced in half of the building. All the plumbing fixtures were replaced, all the flooring replaced and everything was painted. Again, the job was completed on schedule and on the agreed to cost. Many of the same subs and in-house personnel from the first job were used which was very satisfying. While parking is at a real premium in the beach community, the neighbor across the street remarked that all the workers were extremely considerate and caused no concerns to the neighborhood or local traffic.
>
> I chose Behr again because their great job management, efficient scheduling, great communication with their project managers, and their fine business practices. In both cases, I worked closely with the project managers and totally enjoyed the interactions. The quality of work met or exceeded all my expectations and is guaranteed for a year."

## Joan Casella
> "Behr Construction has been doing work for us for close to 10 years. Its been a pleasure working with Chris and Tom, both who are honest and up front. Their work is excellent and I like the fact that when they give me a price I don’t end up with twice as much when the job is completed, as have done in the past. In fact, sometimes the job is a little less than the quote. There workers are polite, clean and hardworking. I would highly recommend Behr Construction to anyone wanting quality work done."

## Armen & Rita Baranian
> "It has been almost a year we have been living in our new house and we keep praising ourselves for making the right decision in choosing Behr Construction as our general contractor.
> The company and the employees have demonstrated ultimate professionalism with special touch of personal attention. Big thank you to “BEHR Construction”!"

## The Kniering Family
> "Sarah and I want to tell you how pleased we are with the way the kitchen project turned out. Your planning and budgeting were right on target and, according to many friends, completing the job in six weeks deserves a medal.
> Contributing to the finished product was the fact that your employees and sub-contractors were all very good at their specialties, had good attitudes and kept the disruption to a minimum. Coming in under budget is always a pleasant surprise.
>
> Chris, you have worked with the Kniering family for about fifteen years now, and that in itself is a good recommendation. If you wish to have prospective clients touch base with us, that is one of the dividends earned from a job well done."

## Wiley & Marilyn Bunn
> "I am enclosing some pictures of our finished project. We are still decorating but the construction and landscaping are done.
> We wanted to thank you for a great job. We are very pleased with the result. The expanded dining room was wonderful when we had 24 here for Thanksgiving dinner!
>
> With all good wishes."

## Ron and Kaguko
> "Thank you very much for your dedicated service in our home remodel. The bathroom came out so beautiful. We will enjoy it for a long time to come. Your hard work and kind thoughts we feel was more than just doing your job.
>
> Shortly after we started the remodel my husband became very sick and stayed in the hospital. Taking care of him and going to work at the office was very stressful but you took care of everything for me and suggested what we do. Without your support I couldn’t go through this. We are very grateful and appreciate you.
>
> Thank you very much again."

## Betty and Greg
> "Thank you so much for all you did to the Glendale house to completion. The tenants are happy and we were extremely pleased with all you did for us. Thank you also for the great bottle of wine! It was very good!!!"

## Claire Taylor (Taylor Brothers Architectural Products)
> "Taylor Brothers Architectural Products would like to thank all the team at Behr Construction for being such a great customer! During the 12 years we have been doing business we have really gotten to know most of the Behr team. From Accounting to job supers … everyone is in great communication and works on the same side of the desk with our team here at Taylor Brothers. We appreciate your business and your care and service level you provide your customers in wanting to get the right product for their project! It is obvious that the Management at Behr Construction sets the standards high for the company and we as your suppliers appreciate that. Thank you for all your do in making Los Angeles a more beautiful community."

## Mary Zaun (On behalf of the Zaun family)
> "On behalf of the Zaun family I wish to share our thoughts regarding our project and thank you for your excellent service regarding the quality restoration and remodel of our mothers’ home. We give Behr Construction the highest recommendation.
>
> We knew going into the project there would be many changes from the original bid proposal and contract due to the poor condition and age of the home. As each “surprise”, such as rotting floors was uncovered, Behr met the challenge with proposed solutions and, when possible, suggested materials and cost variations from which we could choose. The Behr team never judged the condition of the home; and for that we were grateful. They focused on restoring the home to the same quality or better. Their advice regarding materials and construction was excellent and the outcome was absolutely beautiful!
>
> It was clear the Behr Team worked as a cohesive team using solid business practices. They were consistently professional and positive. Communication was immediate and management members in the field had authority to make decisions enabling the project to move forward in a timely manner. Subcontractors selected by Behr were wonderful craftsmen and exhibited the same professionalism as Behr’s team. Information from subcontractors was communicated through Behr within 1-24 hours. If the subcontractor was on site the decision was made immediately through the project manager. From the original bid package, to change orders (which we expected), to billing updates, all documents were clear and easy to understand. We appreciated the clear communication in all aspects of the project.
>
> Behr Project Manager, Matt Vuyovich, is an asset to the Behr Team and was key to the success of the project. We appreciated the extra attention he gave to our project knowing we were anxious to have our 96 year old mother move back into her home as soon as possible. His ability to schedule and coordinate the many aspects of the project allowed the project to be completed two weeks ahead of the contract completion date. Additionally, Matt V’s attention to detail was amazing. He noticed items needing attention we had long forgotten, and our home now looks better than we could have imagined.
>
> We were not Behr’s largest or grandest project, but each member of the team, especially Matt V., treated this project as if it was. Behr Construction has a culture of respect, courtesy and excellence that carries into each project. We now have a newly restored home for our mother and we also gained a new group of Behr friends."
